# Layouts file which configures the cloning of SVN repositories into Git
# repositories.
#
# This is a CSV file with three fields:
#  1. The SVN repository name (not full URL)
#  2. The Git repository name
#  3. The arguments to git svn other than the --authors-file argument
#
# There may be one line with both fields 1 and 2 blank, this represents the
# default argument set for SVN repositores not listed in this file, these
# repositories will be cloned to git repositories having the same name. Other
# than this default layout line, field one must not be empty
#
# If field two (the git repository name) is empty, the git repository will be
# given the same name as the SVN repository from which it is cloned.
#
# If field three (the layout arguments) is empty, no action will be taken for.
# the repository (git svn clone will not be executed). This is a valid option
# for the default line as well.
#
# git svn commands are built using this file in the following pattern:
#     git svn clone --authors-file=[authors file] $3 [SVN Base URL]/$1 $2
# 
,,--stdlayout
