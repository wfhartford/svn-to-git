# SVN to Git Migration Helper Scripts

This repository consists of scripts used during the migration of many Subversion repositories to Git. This uses the [svn-all-fast-export](https://github.com/svn-all-fast-export/svn2git) tool which is much faster and more flexible than git-svn, but does not support one- or two- way synchronisation.
