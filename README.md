# SVN to Git Migration Helper Scripts

This repository consists of scripts used during the migration of many Subversion repositories to Git. This is based on the wonderful guide from Atlassian which is at [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/migrating-overview]. These scripts aim to automate the steps in this guide for use across a large number of repositories.
